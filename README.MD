# deck.loeber.live

Used to host slideshows,  presentations, and other experiments by Zachary Loeber

## Additional information

While I use this site for kicking out markdown/hugo/reveal.js based presentation content there is also some decent scaffolding in here worth recycling for other projects. Namely:
- Makefile for previewing content and consuming .env files in the config folder
- azure-pipeline.yml -> setup to deploy this site back to its own repo in an automated pipeline
- render.yaml -> used to automatically update site configuration within render.com
